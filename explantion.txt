Today we are going to see a responsive image gallery using pure HTML, CSS amd JS. 

So lets start with with adding boiler plate in a HTML document.
In a HTML documnet a title is given a the top named Reponsive Image Gallery 
to enhance the user that of what type of a webpage he/she had visited

 In this page click events are controlled by javascript. We have created page named script.js for this page.
 On the webapge when you click on image  openModal() function will be called.
 In this function display property of <div> tag having id "myModal" will set to "block" and will be displayed as seperate block
 and size of this block will set to display size.

 Immediately after calling openModel() function currentSlide() function is called.
 currentSlide() function we set index of current image and call showSlides() function. 
showSlides() function takes index of current image as argument. 
In showSlides() function we set display property of all elements having id "mySlides" to none.
 by doing this all images will be invisible.

after that the we change display property of <div> tag to "block"  which is at position "slideIndex".
 And it shows single image.

On this screen you will see next button, previous button and close button.

When you click next button, plusSlides() function will be called. 
This function will increase "slideIndex" and call showSlides() functin.
showSlides() function will show slide at slideIndex.

When you click previous button again plusSlides() function will  be called but at this time "-1" is passed as argument
 to this function and it will decrease slideIndex by on and show previous image.
